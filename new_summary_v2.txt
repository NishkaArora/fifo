for # training iterations:
    

        for (thermal, rgb) in dataloader:
            eval seg network
            generate features for the 2 images

            for layer 0 and layer 1:
                make gram matrices, make vectors out of gram matrices, and pass through the DomainFilter
                find DomainFilter loss
        
            Domain Filter Loss is propagated backward
            update domain filter network weights

        for (thermal, rgb) in dataloader:
            get RGB segmentation loss
            get thermal segmentation loss

            find f_a and f_b, calculate FSM loss across layers of fogpassfilters

            loss = loss_thermal + loss_RGB + args.lambda_fsm*loss_fsm
            update seg network weights
